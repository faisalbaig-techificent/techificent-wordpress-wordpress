                                    persistent problem—if only you could build it? Being able to bring an idea to life
                                    is a
                                    powerful feeling that was once strictly the privilege of skilled developers. Today,

                                <h6 class="mb-4">What is WYSIWYG?</h6>
                                <p>WYSIWYG (pronounced wiz-ee-wig) is an acronym for “What You See Is What You Get”, a
                                    type of no code software builder that uses visual development to create software
                                    without code. You can see what the final product will look like as you’re building
                                    it, which is what makes WYSIWYG development so much more intuitive and
                                    user-friendly.</p>
                                <p>Instead of writing source code in a particular programming language or using markup
                                    language like HTML, you can visually arrange and customize elements using a
                                    drag-and-drop interface. You can “drag” various design elements—such as buttons,
                                    text, or image galleries—and “drop” them where you want them to appear in the final
                                    product, whether that's a web page or a mobile app.</p>
                                <p>The first true WYSIWYG software was the Bravo word processor, built in 1974 by
                                    Charles Simonyi and Butler Lampson, which ran on Xerox Alto computers. Since then,
                                    WYSIWYG technology has become much more powerful, even giving non-technical users
                                    the ability to create the apps that power multi-million dollar operations.</p>

                                <p>WYSIWYG interfaces are widely used in tools today. You might picture web design tools
                                    when you think of WYSIWYG editors, and while they fit the bill, websites are just
                                    one type of WYSIWYG application you can build. In fact, many of us use WYSIWYG
                                    platforms in our day-to-day work without even realizing it, and businesses of all
                                    sizes run different aspects of their operations using everything from WYSIWYG app
                                    makers to email marketing platforms.</p>

                                            and the “preview” environment, where you would see what your code looks like
                                            for your end users.

                                            — Most WYSIWYG software will be compatible with APIs and third-party
                                            services to add advanced functionality to the final product users can build.
                                            Examples of integrations include the ability to process payments, send
                                            emails, and implement advanced analytics.

                                            — WYSIWYG editors help you manipulate data more easily and visualize it
                                            using charts and dashboards so you can use it to better inform their work.
                                            Editors can connect to different data sources, such as SQL databases and
                                            spreadsheets, letting you work with that data visually instead of through a
                                            packed spreadsheet interface.

                                <p>WYSIWYG software eases the barrier to entry for software development. Building
                                    beautiful, functional software that can handle small and large operations is
                                    possible for most people with a WYSIWYG editor.</p>

                                            — WYSIWYG editors are designed to be accessible to non-technical users,
                                            meaning you don't need coding skills or a deep understanding of software to
                                            use them effectively.

                                            — Traditional software development is very slow. WYSIWYG applications have
                                            done most of the slow, laborious coding for you before you start building.
                                            As a result, you get a shortcut to well-designed software with a lot less
                                            time and labor invested in the final output.

                                            — Using WYSIWYG software enables you to deliver consistent design and
                                            functionality across every screen of your product. This translates into a
                                            better user experience for your website visitors or customers.

                                            — WYSIWYG editing eliminates the need for specialized development teams,
                                            significantly lowering development costs. Even if you do hire a no code
                                            developer, they’re able to work faster and produce a final output more
                                            affordably.

                                            — WYSIWYG editors can handle projects of varying sizes, from one-page
                                            websites to large-scale data-heavy apps. You don’t have to jump into the
                                            deep end with a WYSIWYG application. You can start with only the features
                                            that are most important and gradually add more complexity as your needs
                                            grow, without having to rebuild your app from scratch.

                                            — Whether you build for web or mobile-first, the best WYSIWYG platforms are
                                            designed so that your layout automatically adjusts for different devices and
                                            works well on all screen types. You design once, not separately, for mobile
                                            and desktop devices.

                                    be aware of when it comes to building products using WYSIWYG software.
                                </p>

                                            — Every new software comes with a learning curve, especially one that
                                            empowers you to build professional, enterprise-grade apps. While WYSIWYG
                                            editors are designed to simplify the process of building software, you’ll
                                            still have to spend some time familiarizing yourself with its features,
                                            functionality, and interface. Some are easier to learn than others.

                                        <p><strong>Fewer visual customization options</strong>
                                            — WYSIWYG software straight out of the box limits you to using its
                                            predefined visual components. If you want to personalize it further, you'll
                                            need to insert custom code
                                        </p>

                                            — Some WYSIWYG editors can generate excess HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
                                            compared to a custom-coded website or app, which could lead to slower
                                            loading times for users.

                                            its roadmap for which new features it releases, and how quickly it does so.
                                            You’ll need to select a platform with a team behind it that you trust.

                                            — To make software that solves a business need, your product should provide
                                            a well-designed user experience. This involves understanding the principles

                                    for just the basics. Instead, look for a WYSIWYG editor that goes beyond just
                                    drag-and-drop to offer advanced capabilities that make it easier for you to build
                                    powerful, professional software.

                                            — First, ensure the WYSIWYG editors you’re researching can build the type of
                                            project you need. App builders, for example, might build progressive web
                                            apps or native apps. If you want to build a business tool, look for a
                                            builder that makes web apps. A web app is accessed through your browser, so
                                            it is useable on any device. This makes it easier for you and your team to
                                            access your tools and work from unified data. If you’re building an app as a
                                            product, look for a native app builder. A native app is downloaded onto a
                                            user’s phone from an app store specific to their operating system, making
                                            them more suited to being created as a product for public use.

                                            also try to find what’s on the roadmap. Some companies make their roadmaps

                                            — Your data may live in one or more sources outside of the WYSIWYG software
                                            you choose. Check the software’s data source integrations to see if it
                                            supports the platforms you want to pull your data in from. Many WYSIWYG
                                            software builders will also let you manually add data, such as email
                                            marketing platforms where you add email copy in the user interface, or app
                                            builders that store data in their native data source. Look for a platform
                                            that can handle your data needs as you scale.

                                            — This is how well the WYSIWYG platform helps you learn how to use the
                                            product and troubleshoot issues. Customer education can come in various
                                            forms, including courses, a robust knowledge base, and an active user

                                            — Check the WYSIWYG software’s features for analytics that enable you to
                                            monitor aspects like product or app usage, traffic, and engagement. This
                                            data will help you understand how your product is being used, how to make it
                                            better and determine its return on investment.

                                <p>The “best” WYSIWYG editor for you will depend on many factors—the most important
                                    being what you’re trying to build. There’s no point trying to build an app with a
                                    website builder or CMS, or to use a word processing tool to create a slide deck.
                                </p>
                                <p>Here are some steps to take when evaluating WYSIWYG platforms.</p>

                                            — Look for the WYSIWYG software options available for what you’re trying to
                                            build. A simple Google search for terms like “WYSIWYG website builders” or
                                            “WYSIWYG app makers” can help you find different platforms for your
                                            category.
                                        </p>

                                        <p><strong>Narrow down your needs</strong>
                                            — Think about whether you want to build a product that’s simple or complex.
                                            Then, list the “must-have” and ”nice-to-have” features for your final
                                            product.
                                        </p>
                                    </li>

                                        <p><strong>Consider your budget</strong>
                                            — You’ll have a budget mapped out for this build, so compare it against the
                                            pricing plans for the different software options. Look for the features you
                                            need and whether the plans that include these features fit into your budget.

                                        <p><strong>Evaluate the customer experience</strong>
                                            — Do some research to see what the customer experience might be like for
                                            you. How easy does the software make it for you to learn? Are there
                                            templates to get you started and an updated knowledge base for you to refer
                                            to? What are the different support options if you need to reach out for
                                            help?

                                            — The best way to see if a WYSIWYG editor works for you is to use it. Almost
                                            every WYSIWYG software will have a free plan or free trial, so make the most
                                            of it and test different builders to find the best fit for your
                                            requirements.
